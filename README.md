# KudoMate — Peer Productivity Web App  

**KudoMate** is a web app designed to make productivity fun and accountable.  
Users can create or join study rooms, complete tasks, and earn or lose credits (kudos) based on their progress.  
The goal is to encourage consistency, teamwork, and self-discipline through friendly peer motivation.  

This project was built as a personal learning journey to understand full-cycle web development — from setting up user systems to designing an engaging interface.
